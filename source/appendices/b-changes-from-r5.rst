Appendix B: Changes from Release 5
==================================

Note: The main Code of Practice document takes precedence in the case of any conflicts between it and this appendix.

Starting with Release 5.0.2 the COUNTER Code of Practice Release 5 is maintained in the GitHub repository `Project-Counter/cop5 <https://github.com/Project-Counter/cop5>`_, and all changes are tracked with GitHub issues and linked pull requests. The `change log <https://github.com/Project-Counter/cop5/blob/5.1/CHANGELOG.rst>`_ lists all changes by type and impact of the change.


Primary changes between R5 and R5.1
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **Item becoming the unit of reporting** - Improved OA reporting is one of the major objectives of R5.1, which requires reporting at the level of the item. This impacts on reporting of book usage: under R5.1, usage of each Book_Segment (e.g. chapter) MUST be reported as a separate item investigation or request, with multiple item investigations or requests rolled up to 1 title investigation or request per book.
* **Data_Type** - Many publishers reported difficulties with the restricted list of Data_Types provided in R5, so the list has been expanded and the definitions and use of each Data_Type clarified.
* **Section_Type** - The impact of the above changes means Section_Type is removed in R5.1.
* **Access_Type** - R5.1 clarifies where and how COUNTER Access_Types apply. R5.1 also introduced revised definitions for Access_Types to better facilitate reporting of open and free materials.
* **Components** - Required for the Item Report in R5, Components are optional in R5.1 to simplify delivery of Item Reports.
* **Report headers** - R5.1 added a link to the `COUNTER Registry <https://registry.projectcounter.org>`_ to the standard report header in both JSON and tabular reports.
* **SUSHI URLs** - Starting with Release 5.1, the release version number will need to be included in the SUSHI URL path.
* **SUSHI authentication** - R5.1 removes support for IP-based authentication in the COUNTER_SUSHI API. API key may be used if a replacement is desired.
* **SUSHI endpoints** - The /status endpoint is public in R5.1 to allow users to easily check whether a service is live. The /reports endpoint is extended to return information about the first and last months for which data are available. We are also introducing separate parameters for common extensions.
* **JSON** - Key changes are upgrading to the OpenAPI3.1/JSON schema, and other changes that result in a more compact, easier-to-parse schema.


Smaller and optional changes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **Global Reports** - R5 introduced the concept of “The World” reporting - that is, a report showing total global usage of content, wherever it comes from (institutional or otherwise). R5.1 recommends that all report providers should provide reports at the global level.
* **Item Reports** - Other changes introduced in R5.1 (e.g. optional Components) simplify delivery of Item Reports. All Host_Types are therefore encouraged to offer the IR.
* **Global Item Reports** - All Host_Types are encouraged to provide a Global Item Report.
* **Report naming** - R5.1 uses the terms COUNTER Reports and Standard Views of COUNTER Reports in place of Master Reports and Standard Views.
* **Audits** - The audit process is clarified and the audit scripts rationalised in R5.1 compared with R5.
* **Versioning** - We have clarified the versioning process for future Code of Practice releases.
