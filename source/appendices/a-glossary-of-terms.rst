     -

   * - Search
     - A user-driven intellectual query, typically equated to submitting the search form of the online service to the server.

       For COUNTER reports a search is counted any time a system executes a search to retrieve a new set of results. This means that systems that perform multiple searches (e.g. search for exact match, search for words in subject, general search) to return a single set of results must only count a single search, not multiple searches. Things that do count as separate searches:

       * Bento-box or multi-tab user interfaces, where multiple searches are conducted to retrieve and present multiple result sets
       * Refinement of a set of search results by faceting, where applying a facet or filter requires the search to be re-run
       * Browsing through a topics list or subject authority file, where clicking on the topic or subject conducts a search to present a set of search results

       Note that link resolution never counts as a search.
