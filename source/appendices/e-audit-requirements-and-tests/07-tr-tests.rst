E.7 Title Report Audit Tests
----------------------------

This section of the appendix outlines tests that MUST be run during audits for Aggregated_Full_Content Host_Types required to offer the Title Report but which do not include books and/or reference works (which would be subject to book-related TR_B1, TR_B2, and TR_B3 audit tests) or journal (which would be subject to journal-related TR_J1, TR_J2, TR_J3 and TR_J4 audit tests).

The Title Report will be COUNTER-compliant for journal content if the following audit tests are passed. 

Audit test requirements vary depending on the set up of the platform, as indicated by the Options within the tests below.

For ease of reading the term ‘item' has been used to indicate content items within TR. This covers all Data_Types within the scope of the TR other than Book, Journal and Reference_Work, namely

* Conference
* Newspaper_or_Newsletter
* Other
* Patent
* Report
* Standard
* Thesis_or_Dissertation
* Unspecified


E.7 Access Types
""""""""""""""""

Within the Title Report, breakdowns by Access_Type are essential. There are therefore a series of audit tests designed to determine report providers’ compliance with requirements for reporting Access_Type.

**Option 1**: Report provider offers items under just one Access_Type.

The auditor MUST request 100 items.

This MUST result in 100 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests with the appropriate Access_Type.

**Option 2**: Report provider offers items under two Access_Types.

The auditor MUST request 50 items with each Access_Type.

This MUST result in 50 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests with each Access_Type.

The Access_Type combinations might be: Controlled plus Open, Controlled plus Free_To_Read, or Open plus Free_To_Read.

**Option 3**: Report provider offers Controlled, Open and Free_To_Read items.

The auditor MUST request

* 40 items with Access_Type Controlled.
* 40 items with Access_Type Open.
* 20 items with Access_Type Free_To_Read.

This MUST result in 40 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests with Access_Type Controlled; the same again for Access_Type Open; and 20 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests with Access_Type Free_To_Read.


E.6.2 Total_Item_Requests and Unique_Item_Requests
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Where possible, 50% of items requested SHOULD be via browsing the platform and 50% via searching the platform. If either browsing or searching is not possible, all items can be requested via the only available option.

The auditor MUST make a total of 80 requests against 40 different items, resulting in 80 each of Total_Item_Investigations and Total_Item_Requests, and 40 each of Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests.


E.6.3 Total_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Investigations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This test is required when investigations can be reported independently of a request. If all investigations have a matching request, please apply to the COUNTER Project Director for an audit exception prior to the audit commencing.

Where possible, 50% of items investigated SHOULD be via browsing the platform and 50% via searching the platform. If either browsing or searching is not possible, all items may be investigated via the only available option.

The auditor MUST make a total of 80 investigations against 40 different items, resulting in 80 Total_Item_Investigations and 40 Unique_Item_Investigations.
