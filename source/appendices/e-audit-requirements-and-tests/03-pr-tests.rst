E.3 Platform Report Audit Tests
-------------------------------

This section of the appendix outlines tests that MUST be run during all audits, and which are specific to the Platform Report.

The Platform Report will be COUNTER-compliant if the following audit tests are passed. The Platform Usage (PR_P1) Standard View of the Platform Report will be COUNTER-compliant if the metrics match those in the Platform Report, with the appropriate aggregation.

Audit test requirements vary depending on the set up of the platform, as indicated by the Options within the tests below.

Platform Report tests apply to all Host_Types.


E.3.1 Searches_Platform
"""""""""""""""""""""""

**Option 1**: Platform has multiple databases and the user can search the whole platform, multiple selected databases, or a single database.

The auditor MUST run 100 searches on the platform

* 50 searches against only 1 selected database.

The auditor MUST run 100 searches on the platform

**Option 3**: Platform has multiple databases but the user can only search the whole platform OR the platform has just one database.

The auditor MUST run 100 searches on the platform.

The auditor activity MUST result in 100 Searches_Platform (1 per search).

The auditor activity MUST result in 100 Searches_Platform (1 per search).

E.3.2 Platform Investigations and Requests
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Where possible, 50% of items requested SHOULD be via browsing the platform and 50% via searching the platform. If either browsing or searching is not possible, all items can be requested via the only available option.

**Option 1**: Platforms with mixtures of Data_Types including Data_Type=Book and/or Reference_Work.

The auditor MUST make a total of 100 requests

* 50 requests against different items with Data_Type other than Book and/or Reference_Work.

If a platform only delivers book and/or reference work content as a single download, and it is not possible to identify Book_Segments and/or Reference_Items, then each request MUST be for a separate book and/or reference work. In this case the auditor activity MUST result in 100 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests, and 50 each of Unique_Title_Investigations and Unique_Title_Requests (1 per book and/or reference work).

If a platform only delivers book and/or reference work content as a single download, and it is not possible to identify Book_Segments and/or Reference_Items, then each request MUST be for a separate book and/or reference work. In this case the auditor activity MUST result in 100 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests, and 100 each of Unique_Title_Investigations and Unique_Title_Requests (1 per book and/or reference work).
