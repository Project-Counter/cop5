E.2 Audit Tests
---------------

E.2.1 Validation Tool
"""""""""""""""""""""

Once reports are available for testing (i.e. up to 28 days after the end of the seeding month), auditors MUST run the COUNTER Reports and Standard Views of COUNTER Reports that are within the scope of the audit through the Validation Tool. This test must include all attributes content providers are required to support, including attributes that are included only if called for.

Where report providers have elected to follow the pre-flight preparation step outlined in Section 9 of the Code of Practice, this audit test should not result in any errors.


E.2.2 Platform Report Audit Tests
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Platform Report will be COUNTER-compliant if the following audit tests are passed. The Platform Usage (PR_P1) Standard View of the Platform Report will be COUNTER-compliant if the metrics match those in the Platform Report, with the appropriate aggregation.

Audit test requirements vary depending on the set up of the platform, as indicated by the Options within the tests below.

Platform Report tests apply to all Host_Types.

E.2.4 Title Report Audit Tests: Books and Reference_Works
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Title Report will be COUNTER-compliant for book and/or reference work content if the following audit tests are passed. The book-related Standard Views of the Title Report (TR_B1, TR_B2, TR_B3) will be COUNTER-compliant if the metrics match those in the Title Report, with the appropriate aggregation.

Audit test requirements vary depending on the set up of the platform, as indicated by the Options within the tests below.

Title Report audit tests for books and reference works apply to Host_Types Aggregated_Full_Content, eBook, and eBook_Collection.

Note that Data_Types Book and Reference_Work are included in the audit tests, as Reference_Works are included in the book-related Standard Views of the Title Report.

E.2.4.1 Unique_Title_Investigations and Unique_Title_Requests

Audit test requirements vary depending on the set up of the platform, as indicated by the Options within the tests below.

Title Report audit tests for journals apply to Host_Types Aggregated_Full_Content and eJournal.

For ease of reading the term âjournal articlesâ has been used to indicate content items within Data_Type=Journal.


E.2.5.1 Journal Access Types
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Within the Title Report, breakdowns by Access_Type are essential. There are therefore a series of audit tests designed to determine report providersâ compliance with requirements for reporting Access_Type. These tests only apply where Journals with more than one Access_Type are available on a platform.

**Option 1**: Report provider offers journal articles under two Access_Types.

The auditor MUST request 50 journal articles with each Access_Type.

This MUST result in 50 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests with each Access_Type.

E.2.5.2 Total_Item_Requests and Unique_Item_Requests
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Where possible, 50% of items requested SHOULD be via browsing the platform and 50% via searching the platform. If either browsing or searching is not possible, all items can be requested via the only available option.

The auditor MUST make a total of 80 requests against 40 different journal articles, resulting in 80 each of Total_Item_Investigations and Total_Item_Requests, and 40 each of Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests.

Where a platform has fewer than 80 items, the auditor MUST make at least one request per item and testing should result in 80 each of Total_Item_Investigations and Total_Item_Requests, and the item-count of Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests.


E.2.5.3 Total_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This test is required when investigations can be reported independently of a request. If all investigations have a matching request, please apply to the COUNTER Project Director for an audit exception prior to the audit commencing.

Where possible, 50% of items investigated SHOULD be via browsing the platform and 50% via searching the platform. If either browsing or searching is not possible, all items may be investigated via the only available option.

E.2.5.4 Journal Year of Publication
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For journal content, year of publication (YOP) is useful in evaluating usage of archive content.

The auditor MUST confirm the Year of Publication (YOP) of articles covered in other audit tests described in this section of the appendix (headings E.2.5.1, E2.5.2 and E.2.5.3) with appropriate and proportionate spot checks covering a minimum of 10% of all journal articles tested.

If the YOP appearing in the reports is different from that of the journal article for more than 10% of the checked items, the auditor must expand their spot checks to cover at least 25% of tested journal articles. If 10% or more of the journal articles have a different YOP from that in the reports, the report provider has failed the Journal YOP audit test.


E.2.6 Item Report Audit Tests
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Item Report will be COUNTER-compliant if the following audit tests are passed. The Standard Views of the Item Report (IR_A1 and IR_M1) will be COUNTER-compliant if the metrics match those in the Item Report.

Item Report audit tests apply to Host_Types Data_Repository, Multimedia, Repository, and Scholarly_Collaboration_Network. Auditors SHOULD also run Item Report audit tests on other Host_Types that have opted to provide Item Reports.

In order for the Item Report to be accurately audited, the report provider MUST supply the auditor with a list of Data_Types represented on the platform.

Note that because Components are optional for Release 5.1, they SHOULD be omitted from Item Report audit tests.

E.2.6.1 Total_Item_Requests and Unique_Item_Requests
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The auditor MUST make a total of 100 requests on 50 unique items representing the scope of the platform. That is, where a platform is made up of a mixture of content with Data_Types Audio, Patent and Report, the auditor should represent each of those Data_Types proportionately in the audit test.

This MUST result in 100 Total_Item_Requests and 50 Unique_Item_Requests. The auditor MUST record the Data_Types for each item (e.g. Audio) and the resulting Item Report MUST reflect those records.


E.2.7 Audit Tests for Double-Click Filtering
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This audit test applies to investigations and requests metrics across all COUNTER Reports and should represent the scope of the platform. That is, where a platform is made up of a mixture of content with Data_Types Article, Multimedia and Patent, the auditor should represent each of those Data_Types proportionately in the audit test.

The test consists of making requests to an item twice in succession (double-clicks). If the two clicks occur within a 30-second time-span, only the second request MUST be recorded, resulting in 1 Total_Item_Investigation and 1 Total_Item_Request. If the two clicks occur with more than 30 seconds between them, then 2 Total_Item_Investigations and Total_Item_Requests must be counted. In both cases only 1 Unique_Item_Investigation and 1 Unique_Item_Request will be reported.

The auditor MUST carry out a total of 30 tests:

* 15 âInsideâ tests, whereby 2 identical requests are made and the second request is within 30 seconds of the first.
* 15 âOutsideâ tests, whereby 2 identical requests are made and the second request is more than 30 seconds after the first.

The âInsideâ tests MUST result in 15 each of Total_Item_Investigations, Total_Item_Requests, Unique_Item_Investigations and Unique_Item_Requests, and the âOutsideâ tests MUST result in 30 Total_Item_Investigations, 30 Total_Item_Requests, 15 Unique_Item_Investigations and 15 Unique_Item_Requests, for a total of 45 Total_Item_Investigations, 45 Total_Item_Requests, 30 Unique_Item_Investigations and 30 Unique_Item_Requests.


E.2.8 Audit Tests for Denials
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Report providers operating platforms where turnaways or denials are in operation MUST be subject to audit tests for denials. For report providers operating multiple platforms, the audit scope as defined in :numref:`audit` MUST include platforms where turnaways or denials are in operation. Where either Limit_Exceeded or No_License denials do not apply to a report provider, auditors MUST note this in the audit report. This does not require an exemption from the COUNTER Project Director.

These audit tests apply to denial metrics across all COUNTER Reports and should represent the scope of the platform under audit. That is, where a platform is made up of a mixture of content with Data_Types Article, Multimedia and Patent, the auditor SHOULD represent each of those Data_Types proportionately in the audit test.


E.2.8.1 Limit_Exceeded
''''''''''''''''''''''

Note that the account used for this testing MUST have concurrent / simultaneous-user limit (concurrency limits) set at a single user. A second user attempting to access the database would be denied.

**Option 1**: The report provider denies the user access when the concurrency limit is exceeded upon login.

The auditor MUST force 50 Limit_Exceeded access denials by logging into the site causing the user limit to reach the maximum allowance. The auditor will then attempt to log into the site using a different computer, or a different browser, which should be refused access. Each time access is refused, the auditor will record this as 1 Limit_Exceeded.

The test MUST result in 50 Limit_Exceeded.

**Option 2**: The report provider denies the user access when the concurrency limit is exceeded upon searching or accessing a database.

The auditor MUST force 50 Limit_Exceeded turnaways by logging into the site, then either selecting and searching a database or browsing to a database causing the user limit to reach the maximum allowance. The auditor will then log into the same site using a different computer, or a different browser, and repeat the action, which should be refused access. Each time access is refused, the auditor will record this as 1 Limit_Exceeded.

The test MUST result in 50 Limit_Exceeded.

**Option 3**: The report provider denies the user access when the concurrency limit is exceeded upon accessing a content item.

The auditor MUST force 50 Limit_Exceeded turnaways by logging into the site and requesting an item, causing the user limit to reach the maximum allowance. The auditor will then log into the site again using a different computer, or a different browser, and repeat the action, which should be refused access. Each time access is refused, the auditor will record this as 1 Limit_Exceeded.

The test MUST result in 50 Limit_Exceeded.


E.2.8.2 No_Licence
''''''''''''''''''

The content for which the auditor has no license MUST be declared by the report provider prior to audit testing.

The auditor MUST force 50 No_License turnaways by logging into the site and requesting an item. Each time access is refused, the auditor will record this as 1 No_License.

The test MUST result in 50 No_License.
