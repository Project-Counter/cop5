Activity generated by internet robots and crawlers MUST be excluded from all COUNTER usage reports. COUNTER provides a list of user agent values that represent the crawlers and robots that MUST be excluded. Any transaction with a user agent matching one on the list MUST NOT be included in COUNTER reports.

COUNTER maintains the current list of internet robots and crawlers at `COUNTER Robots <https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots>`_.
