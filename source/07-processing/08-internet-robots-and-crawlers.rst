Internet Robots and Crawlers
----------------------------

Activity generated by internet robots and crawlers MUST be excluded from all COUNTER usage reports. COUNTER provides a (non-comprehensive) list of user agent values that represent the crawlers and robots that MUST be excluded. Any transaction with a user agent matching one on the list MUST NOT be included in COUNTER reports. Usage by other robots and crawlers that can be identified by the report provider MUST NOT be included in COUNTER Reports. Report providers SHOULD alert COUNTER to common robots and crawlers using code@countermetrics.org.

COUNTER maintains the current list of internet robots and crawlers at `COUNTER Robots <https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots>`_.
