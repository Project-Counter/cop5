Discovery Services and Other Multiple-Database Searches
-------------------------------------------------------

Search activity generated by discovery services and other systems where multiple databases are searched simultaneously and the user does not have the option of selecting the databases being searched MUST be counted as Searches_Automated on Database Reports. Such searches MUST be included on the Platform Reports as Searches_Platform, but only as a single search regardless of the number of databases searched.

Example: A user searches a content site where 20 databases have been pre-selected for business and economics searches and the user does not have the option to change the selection. For each search conducted by the user:

* In the Database Report, each of the 20 databases gets credit for 1 Searches_Automated.
* In the Platform Report, Searches_Platform gets credited by 1.
