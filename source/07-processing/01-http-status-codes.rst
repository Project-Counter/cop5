HTTP Status Codes
-----------------

Only successful and valid requests MUST be counted. For web server log files successful requests are those with specific HTTP status codes (200 and 304). The standards for HTTP status codes are defined and maintained by the `IETF HTTP working group <https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/documents/>`_ in a series of RFCs (most notably `RFC 7231 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html>`_). If key events are used, their definition MUST match the HTTP standards. (For more information see the `Friendly Technical Notes for Providers <https://www.projectcounter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Release5.0.2_FG_Tech_v3.pdf>`_.)
