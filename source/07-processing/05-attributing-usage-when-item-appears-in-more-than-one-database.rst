Attributing Usage when Item Appears in More Than One Database
-------------------------------------------------------------

Content providers that offer databases where a given content item (e.g. an article) is included in multiple databases MUST attribute the Investigations and Requests metrics to just one database. The following recommendations may be helpful when choosing when ambiguity arises:

* Give priority to databases that the institution has rights to access.
* If there is a priority order for databases for search or display within the platform, credit usage to the highest priority database.
* Beyond that, use a consistent method of prioritizing database, such as by database ID or name.
* If none of the above, pick randomly.
