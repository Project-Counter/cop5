Page Tagging
------------

With the increasing use of cloud services, page tagging is becoming a preferred way to obtain analytics information. Page tagging and tag data analysis can be done in-house, but are also widely available as third-party services

Page tags are small pieces of code embedded in each page of a platform website. Data is gathered via these tags and passed to a database. This data can then be manipulated and stored, allowing complete control over how the data is represented.

A key difference between log file analysis and page tagging is that with page tags a usage count is activated by opening the page in the browser, not by requesting it from the server. This means page tagging is likely to offer a more accurate reflection of usage, because cached pages are counted in the same way as server calls.

Other things to note in respect of page tagging are:

* The data storage and manipulation script may have access to additional information about the web client or the user; for example, by reading information from the report providers' access management system.
* Page-tagging services typically manage the process of assigning cookies to visitors.
