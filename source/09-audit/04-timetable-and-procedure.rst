.. rubric:: Applications for COUNTER-compliant status

* A register of content providers and their platforms for which COUNTER-compliant usage reports are available is maintained by COUNTER and posted on the COUNTER website - https://www.projectcounter.org/about/register/

Upon receipt of the application and proof of compliance, content providers MUST allow at least one of the COUNTER library test sites to evaluate their usage reports.
* When the usage reports are deemed to comply with the COUNTER Code of Practice, the content provider will be asked to sign a Declaration of COUNTER Compliance (:ref:`Appendix C <appendix-c>`), after which the content provider and its platforms will be added to the register.
* Within six months a report from an independent auditor confirming that the usage reports and data are indeed COUNTER-compliant will be required. See :ref:`Appendix E <appendix-e>` for a description of the auditing program.
