Report Filters and Report Attributes
------------------------------------

The COUNTER_SUSHI API specification allows report responses to be customized to the caller’s needs using report filters and report attributes. For Standard Views of the COUNTER Reports, these filters and attributes are implicit. For the COUNTER Reports, the filters and attributes will be explicitly included as parameters on the COUNTER_SUSHI request.

Refer to :numref:`filters-attributes` and the `COUNTER_SUSHI API Specification <https://countermetrics.stoplight.io/docs/counter-sushi-api>`_ for the list of filters and attributes supported by the various COUNTER reports.
