Delivering JSON Reports
-----------------------

* JSON reports MUST be formatted in accordance with the COUNTER_SUSHI API Specification (see :numref:`api`).
* The reports MUST be encoded using UTF-8. JSON reports and other SUSHI server responses MUST NOT include a byte order mark (according to `RFC 8259, Section 8.1 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-8.1>`_).
* JSON Reports MUST be "minimal", i.e. information that can be included in a single objects MUST NOT be split into multiple objects:

  * all Items with the same Parent MUST be included in a single Parent_Item object in Item Reports only (avoids duplicate Parent metadata)
  * all Attribute_Performance objects for the same Item/Title/Database/Platform MUST be included in a single Report_Item object (avoids duplicate item metadata)
  * all Performance for the same Attribute combination MUST be included in a single Attribute_Performance object (avoids duplicate Attribute combinations)

* The reports SHOULD NOT include unnecessary whitespace.
* SUSHI servers SHOULD use HTTP Compression if the client supports it.
* JSON Reports MUST be available for harvesting via the COUNTER_SUSHI API within 4 weeks of the end of the reporting period.
