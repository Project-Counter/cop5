Access to Usage for Consortia
-----------------------------

Separate consortium reports are not provided under R5.1. Consortium managers must be able to access any R5.1 report for their members. To facilitate this:

* The consortium administrator MUST be able to access the usage statistics for individual consortium member institutions, from a single login, using the same user id and password (i.e. without having to logout and back in for each individual institution).
* COUNTER_SUSHI API implementations MUST support the /r51/members path (see :numref:`compliance-consortia` below) to facilitate consortium managers retrieving usage for all members.
