Reserved Elements and Values Available for Extending Reports
------------------------------------------------------------

COUNTER recognizes that there are some common extensions that content providers might want to include in Master Reports or when creating custom reports; therefore the following element names and values have been reserved for this common use:

.. only:: latex

   .. tabularcolumns:: |>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.19}|>{\parskip=\tparskip}\Y{0.57}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.11}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}\Y{0.13}|

.. list-table::
   :class: longtable
   :widths: 14 64 12 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Element Name
     - Description
     - Reports
     - Examples

   * - Customer_ID
     - When a Master Report contains usage for multiple organizations, this element can be used to break the usage down by institution. The Customer_ID MUST match the Customer_ID in the report header in a JSON report for that institution and the Customer_ID for the institution returned by the /members COUNTER_SUSHI API path. If Customer_ID is included in a tabular report, it MUST be the second column if Institution_Name is also included, or the first column if Institution_Name is not included.
     - PR, DR, TR, IR
     - C12345

   * - Institution_Name
     - When a Master Report contains usage for multiple organizations, this element can be used to break the usage down by institution. The Institution_Name MUST match the Institution_Name in the report header in a report for that institution and the Name for the institution returned by the /members COUNTER_SUSHI API path. If Institution_Name is included in a tabular report, it MUST be the first column.
     - PR, DR, TR, IR
     - Mt. Laurel University

   * - Format
     - By tracking the Format, content providers can generate R4 usage reports from R5 usage during the transition period. Reserved values for Format are:

       * HTML
       * PDF
       * Other

       The Format element MUST only be used in the Title Master Report (or custom reports) and for Metric_Type Total_Item_Requests. If Format is included in a tabular report, it MUST be the last column before Metric_Type, and for other Metric_Types than Total_Item_Requests the cells in the Format column MUST be empty.
     - TR
     - PDF

Note that by supporting the Institution_Name and Customer_ID extensions content providers can offer COUNTER Master Reports to consortia with usage broken down by their members. If a consortium requests a report with Institution_Name and/or Customer_ID, the usage would be broken down by institution if the extension is supported by the content provider, otherwise the usage would be summarised over all consortium members as usual.
