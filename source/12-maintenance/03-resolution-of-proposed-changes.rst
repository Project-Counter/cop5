Resolution of Proposed Changes
------------------------------

Responding to Submissions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

The `COUNTER Executive Committee <https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-executive-committee/>`_ (EC) will review submissions and provide a response within 90 days of receipt (to allow discussion at a regularly scheduled EC meeting). The EC will respond to every submission with one of the following, providing clarity when needed:

* Proposed change accepted without modification
* Proposed change accepted with modification
* Proposed change accepted for further study
* Proposed change rejected

If further study is needed, the EC may convene a separate working group to study the proposal and make recommendations related to the suggested comments.


Approval of Changes
"""""""""""""""""""

Changes that are substantive in nature (i.e. would require changes in how reports are generated or consumed) will be presented to COUNTER membership for comments for a period of at least 45 calendar days. All member comments MUST be considered and responded to by the EC or the designated working group.

After the comment period, changes to the COUNTER Code of Practice MUST be voted upon by the COUNTER Executive Committee and approved by committee majority. EC Members can respond to a ballot by voting Yes, No or Abstain. For clarity, the number of affirmative votes MUST be greater than 50% of the total number of EC members minus abstentions (a non-vote is considered a “No” vote.)


Communication of Changes
""""""""""""""""""""""""

COUNTER will inform the COUNTER membership about upcoming changes to the COUNTER Code of Practice through email and on the COUNTER website. Additionally, proposed and pending changes will be published on the `Usus <http://www.usus.org.uk/>`_ website and through posting on listservs that discuss usage topics.


Version and Change Control
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each update to the COUNTER Code of practice will generate a new version number (i.e. the initial release of “R5” will be designated as version 5.0. A non-substantive change (fixing typographical errors) would increment the version by .0.1, creating version 5.0.1. A substantive change (requiring changes in implementation of the Code of Practice) would increment the version by .1, creating version 5.1.

All changes included in each release will be included in the Change History section of the Code of Practice. The prior release will be archived as a PDF document and access to that release provided via the COUNTER website.
