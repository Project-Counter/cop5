Continuous Maintenance
======================

The COUNTER Code of Practice operates under a continuous maintenance procedure to allow incremental changes to be made to the Code of Practice without creating a completely new release. This section describes those procedures.

In R5.1 the COP will transition to use of Explicit Versioning, a four-digit numbering system in the structure Release.Breaking.Feature.Fix, where “Breaking” indicates changes that are not backwards compatible, “Feature” indicates new features or extensions that are backwards compatible, and “Fix” is used for typographic corrections and similar small amendments. Explicit Versioning thus allows for us to change the Release number where changes are so comprehensive that Release 5 would no longer apply.
