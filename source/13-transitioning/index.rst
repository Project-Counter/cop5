Transitioning from Previous Releases or to New Reporting Services
=================================================================

A requirement of the COUNTER Code of Practice is that report providers offer report consumers access to the current year plus the prior 24 months of usage or from the date they first became compliant, whichever is later. This requirement must continue to be met even when a provider may be transitioning to a new release of the COUNTER Code of Practice or if they are moving to a new reporting service.
