COUNTER Code of Practice Release 5.1
====================================

.. Same abstract in conf.py for the PDF version!

.. only:: not latex

   COUNTER’s report consumer and report provider members have contributed to the development of Release 5.1 (R5.1) of the COUNTER Code of Practice.

   The Code of Practice enables report providers to produce consistent, comparable and credible usage data for their online content. This allows report consumers to compare the usage data they receive, and to understand and demonstrate the value of electronic resources.

   Release 5.1 (published 5 May 2023) will become the current Code of Practice and the requirement for COUNTER compliance effective from January 2025.

.. only:: not (latex or builder_html)

   The Code of Practice is maintained by COUNTER. This online version is the version of record for Release 5.1 of the Code of Practice. There is more information about COUNTER on `COUNTER website <https://www.projectcounter.org/>`_.
