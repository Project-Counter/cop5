COUNTER Code of Practice Release 5.0.3
======================================

.. Same abstract in conf.py for the PDF version!

.. only:: not latex

   COUNTER’s library and content provider members have contributed to the development of Release 5 (R5) of the COUNTER Code of Practice.

   The Code of Practice enables content providers to produce consistent, comparable and credible usage data for their online content. This allows librarians and other interested parties to compare the usage data they receive, and to understand and demonstrate the value of the electronic resources to which they subscribe.

   Release 5.0.3 (published 28 April 2023) will become the current Code of Practice and the requirement for COUNTER compliance effective immediately.

.. only:: not (latex or builder_html)

   The Code of Practice is available from the `COUNTER website <https://www.projectcounter.org/>`_ as an interactive code. This online version is the version of record for Release 5 of the Code of Practice.
